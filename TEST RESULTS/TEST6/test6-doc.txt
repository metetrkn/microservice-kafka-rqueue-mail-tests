UNDERSTANDING TEST
report id: 0, 1, 2 are the result of test made with the same paremeters
report id: 3, 4, 5 are the result of test made with new parameters
0, 1, 2 are the same test repeated, 3, 4, 5 are the new tests with new paremeter repeated 

As it seen from report image as much as test repeated with the same paremeters (0,1,2 block or 3,4,5 block) performance increases,
It should be result of cashing or a similar system, ignore this,

COMPARE 0,1, with 1,2 with 4,5

EVAULATION OF TEST
This test made to if not batching for high topics changes performance meaningfully
I have set high topic batching from 1 -> 5 -> 10

0,1 vs 2,3 (1 batch vs 5 batch)
1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 61.94% (Dropped from 4.71 s to 1.79 s)
Max Execution Time: Improved by 50.18%  (Dropped from 6.44 s to 3.21 s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 6.53% (Dropped from 2.61 s to 2.44 s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 6.85% (Dropped from 4.23 s to 3.94 s).

2,3 vs 4,5 (5 batch vs 10 batch)
1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Dropped by 11.71% (Increased from 1.79 s s to 2.00 s)
Max Execution Time: Dropped by 1.52%  (Increased from 3.21 s to 3.26 s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Dropped by 40.61% (Dropped from 2.44 s to 3.42 s).
Max Execution Time: Dropped by +37.88% (Dropped from 3.94 s to 5.44 s).


RESULT:
Not setting batch (bath size=1) is the worst. But setting so much batch is the bad as well.(10 batch). 
Best perfomance was with 5 batch. Solution is setting batch not so much.
Each consumer (in their own topic group) shared similar workload as it should be
