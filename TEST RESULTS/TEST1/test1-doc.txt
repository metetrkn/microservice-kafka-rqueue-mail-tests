Findout if increasing only threads changes performance meaningfully

UNDERSTANDING TEST
report id: 0, 1, 2 are the result of test made with the same paremeters
report id: 3, 4, 5 are the result of test made with new parameters
0, 1, 2 are the same test repeated, 3, 4, 5 are the new tests with new paremeter repeated 

As it seen from report image as much as test repeated with the same paremeters (0,1,2 block or 3,4,5 block) performance increases,
It should be result of cashing or a similar system, ignore this,

COMPARE 0,1,2 with 3,4,5

EVAULATION OF TEST
This test made to findout if increasing only thread numbers for each consumer affect performance
RESULT: I have doubled threads for each topic(4 to 8), there is performance increase, but as seen not drastic

1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 18.28% (Dropped from 2.35s to 1.92s)
Max Execution Time: Improved by 16.76% (Dropped from 3.68s to 3.06s)

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 18.77% (Dropped from 2.78s to 2.26s)
Max Execution Time: Improved by 17.73% (Dropped from 4.36s to 3.59s)

RESULT:
Increasing threads by it self increases the performance, but not drastically
Each consumer (in their own topic group) shared similar workload as it should be
