Findout increasing only consumers changing performance meaningfully

THIS TEST REPERATED 3 TIMES for each scenerio (TOTAL:6)

PARAMETERS that is used for compare

UNDERSTANDING TEST
report id: 0, 1, 2 are the result of the 1st test made with the same paremeters
report id: 3, 4, 5 are the result of 2nd test made with new parameters
0, 1, 2 are the same test repeated, 3, 4, 5 are the new tests with new paremeter repeated 

While consumers continues to run (with the same parameters), results tends to be better.
It should be result of cashing or a similar system, keep this in mind.

COMPARE report_id_0,1,2 group with report_id_3,4,5 group

EVAULATION OF TEST
This test made to findout if increasing only consumers affect performance
RESULT: I have doubled threads for each topic(4 to 8), there is performance increase drasatically
1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Drastically improved by 46.04% (Dropped from 2.22s to 1.20s).
Max Execution Time: Drastically improved by 46.43% (Dropped from 3.54s to 1.89s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Improved by 14.89% (Dropped from 2.59s to 2.20s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 9.10% (Dropped from 4.11s to 3.74s).
