UNDERSTANDING TEST
report id: 0, 1, 2 are the result of test made with the same paremeters
report id: 3, 4, 5 are the result of test made with new parameters
0, 1, 2 are the same test repeated, 3, 4, 5 are the new tests with new paremeter repeated 

AAs it seen from report image as much as test repeated with the same paremeters (0,1,2 block or 3,4,5 block) performance increases,
It should be result of cashing or a similar system, ignore this,

COMPARE 0,1,2 with 3,4,5

EVAULATION OF TEST
This test made to findout if increasing only partions numbers for each consumer affect performance
RESULT: I have doubled partions for each topic(4 to 8),

there is performance decrease

1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Increased by 38.70% (Rose from 1.71s to 2.37s).
Max Execution Time: Increased by 35.93% (Rose from 2.74s to 3.73s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Increased by 15.40% (Rose from 2.27s to 2.62s).
Max Execution Time: Increased by 15.29% (Rose from 3.56s to 4.11s).

RESULT:
Increasing partions by it self DECREASE the performance drastically
Each consumer (in their own topic group) shared similar workload as it should be
