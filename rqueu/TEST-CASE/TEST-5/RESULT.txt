TOTAL EVAULATION OF TESTS FOR CONCURRENCY NUMBERS

Test1-
queu	Usage		Error		concurrency	avg_time	max_time	
high	100		0		5-10		1.19		1.96		
low	1000		0		1-2		51.90		103.73		

Test2-
queu	Usage		Error		concurrency	avg_time	max_time
high	100		0		5-10		1.09		1.77
low	1000		0		5-10		9.11		18.37

Test3-
queu	Usage		Error		concurrency	avg_time	max_time	
high	100		0		10-20		0.45		0.60		
low	1000		0		5-10		8.83		18.09		


Test4-
queu	Usage		Error		concurrency	avg_time	max_time	
high	100		0		10-20		0.94		1.19		
low	1000		0		10-20		4.08		7.96		


Result:
	- Our primary task to create high thoughput system for HIGH mails and
	Test3 returns the best results for high mails and also not the most resource usage.
	CSV files graph evulation also shows that there is drastic decrease in exectuion time 
	from test2 to test3 but there is allmost no change from 3 to 4.

BEST USE CASE is TEST-3!
