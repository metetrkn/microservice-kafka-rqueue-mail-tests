UNDERSTANDING TEST
report id: 0, 1, 2 are the result of the 1st test made with the same paremeters
report id: 3, 4, 5 are the result of 2nd test made with new parameters
0, 1, 2 are the same test repeated, 3, 4, 5 are the new tests with new paremeter repeated 

While consumers continues to run (with the same parameters), results tends to be better.
It should be result of cashing or a similar system, keep this in mind.

COMPARE report_id_0,1,2 group with report_id_3,4,5 group

EVAULATION OF TEST
This test made to findout if increasing only partions numbers for each consumer affect performance
RESULT: I have doubled partions, consumers and threads (4 to 8),
Even though I have allocated double resources, overall performance did not change allmost at all

1. High Priority Mails (high-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Slightly improved by 1.83% (Dropped from 2.30s to 2.25s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 7.00% (Dropped from 3.73s to 3.47s).

2. Low Priority Mails (low-priority-mails)
Average Execution Time: Slightly degraded by 1.12% (Rose from 2.68s to 2.71s).
Max Execution Time: Improved by 6.49% (Dropped from 4.26s to 3.98s).

RESULT:
Increasing partions, threads and consumers at the same time did not change the performance allmost at all.
In prevoius reports, increasing threads or consumers by it self increased performance hence increasing partions decreased performance
Doing all together did not change performance. It can be the reason of consumers and threads increased affect good but partions bad and overall result notr
Each consumer (in their own topic group) shared similar workload as it should be
